        <h2>HOWARD T. DUCK</h2>
        <p>
          I am now residing in Cleveland, Ohio and trying to find my way back to Duckworld, I have this town, I love this town, however, I am tired of people wanting to roast me for a great dinner. I am just one crazy duck wearing goofy clothes and writing code one line at a time. You never no I may become the first Ninja Duck! When I find my way back to Duckworld I hope you miss me and my Ninja Skills. Duck Life is what's UP! Have you seen the new application I built called Duck Feather Love? It's a feathery loving site build by ducks and for ducks! I QUACK myself up majority of the times.
